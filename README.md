# Welcome to my Leetcode journey

Learning computer science fundementals; like algorithms and data structures is always something I've wanted to throw myself into. I've learnt basics before in education but without a CS degree; I have noticed this is a huge grey area, and gap in my resume.

For this reason, I've decided to document my journey into learning these core concepts publicly, to both hold myself accountable, and track my progress somewhere central.

### Language(s)

I want to demonstate the breadth of my knowledge, so decided to split this repository into sections for each language I decide to take on challenges with.

As I write this document, I am a fluent TypeScript developer, with previous; perhaps rusty knowledge in CSharp. I also have aspirations to learn Go (Golang) as I progress. We may see others creep in here too over time.

### Structure

I am splitting my repository up to segregate the different languages I decide to tackle each leetcode problem with. I will also keep a table in this README.md to provide myself and peers with an interface to view challenges completed, with their associated links and difficulty levels. I will also keep README documents for certain challenges if I take something valuable away from the problem at hand.
